I personally find that most social media-driven food trends tend to not live up to the hype. Pasta chips? Pass. Bell pepper sandwich? It&rsquo;s a no from me. Custard toast? Absolutely not. (<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/yogurt-toast-trend/\" target=\"_blank\">Camille&rsquo;s version</a>&nbsp;that doesn&rsquo;t involve eggs is way better, IMO.) However, there was one trend over the last year that I absolutely embraced. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/green-goddess-salad-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\">green goddess salad</a>. And with a few tweaks and hacks thrown in, this (vegan) green goddess pasta salad was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bakedbymelissa.com/blog/green-goddess-salad\" target=\"_blank\">Baked By Melissa&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;take on the salad went viral last year, I heard over and over again from friends who were swearing by the salad. I had to admit after trying it, it&rsquo;s really good. So good, that I started playing around with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/step-up-your-salad-game-with-this-spring-herb-roasted-potato-salad/\" target=\"_blank\">green goddess everything.</a>&nbsp;And in my never-ending quest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/green-sauce-pasta/\" target=\"_blank\">to eat vegetables</a>&nbsp;without eating just a giant bowl of salad, I turned to my bin of pasta in the back of the pantry. And as it turns out, green goddess dressing paired with tender pasta is a match made in heaven.

Against the blue sky they looked pristine. The town is a reasonable size with a population of just under 10,000. Just what we like .<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur first site of the campsite was not favourable . I struggled with the machine but eventually the barrier lifted and we could drive in . It had been an old campsite and looked derelict . The information boards were neglected and the grass long and unkept . We parked up . Our neighbours were around the corner and we were in a relatively sheltered spot but there was a lot of noise from the nearby road . There were two toilet blocks which I went over to in order to investigate . The first was boarded up and looked as if it had been that way for a long time . The second had been boarded up but someone had ripped the boards down . Inside it was a mess. What had once been showers and washing facilities was full&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.travelblog.org/Photos/10365555\" onclick=\"return (&quot;10365555&quot;,&quot;&quot;);\"><img alt=\"My aperitif \" src=\"https://photos.travelblog.net/206245/1066212/t/10365555-my-aperitif-0.jpg\" /><img alt=\"My aperitif \" src=\"https://www.travelblog.org/pix/shim.gif\" />My aperitif</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>of leaves and debris. The third block looked cleaner but that too was boarded up. We sat for a while horrified as the mess and made the decision we would walk up to the town and then drive off to the seaside and stop at a campsite . We needed water, we needed showers and we could not stand this place for two days . The only saving grace was the appearance of a Hoopoe who delighted us by standing and allowing us to photograph this elusive bird.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe walk up to the town was without any pavements. We eventually reached the streets which were full of the traditional Saturday market. And what a market. Along with the thriving shops there was on offer roasted chickens and panfuls of Paella , clothing to flowers and plants for the garden and every manner of thing you could think of . It felt that all the inhabitants of Elne were there doing their weekly shop. We earmarked it for a visit and a shop on the way back down the town . It was uphill all the way. We climbed first through the gateway and climbed the steps to the belvedere&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.travelblog.org/Photos/10365553\" onclick=\"return (&quot;10365553&quot;,&quot;&quot;);\"><img alt=\"The Cathedral \" src=\"https://photos.travelblog.net/206245/1066212/t/10365553-the-cathedral-0.jpg\" /><img alt=\"The Cathedral \" src=\"https://www.travelblog.org/pix/shim.gif\" />The Cathedral</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>where we had a lovely view over the town and towards those snow covered mountains . The air felt crisp clear. The sun was shining and this was proving the best sunny day of the holiday . T Shirts and shorts weather .<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was clear that Elne was divided into upper and lower towns each fortified with towers , gates and very high curtain walls. The upper town was occupied by the very large Cathedral of Sainte Eulalie and Sainte Julie . It looked pretty impressive but the front doors were slammed shut . We walked around the back of the Romanesque building and found ourselves with a choice . Not see the cathedral inside or pay to see both the cathedral and the cloisters . Having been in the cloisters at Moissac just a few days ago we decided to give this one a miss .<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was time for lunch and that was the one thing on our mind . There were no other restaurants up in the upper town other than Caro Sol. It was empty but then it was not quite 11.45 but it did have a menu board outside which advertise a&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.travelblog.org/Photos/10365554\" onclick=\"return (&quot;10365554&quot;,&quot;&quot;);\"><img alt=\"The war memorial on the belverdere\" src=\"https://photos.travelblog.net/206245/1066212/t/10365554-the-war-memorial-on-the-belverdere-0.jpg\" /><img alt=\"The war memorial on the belverdere\" src=\"https://www.travelblog.org/pix/shim.gif\" />The war memorial on the belverdere</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>menu of the day plus an al a carte menu. The menu of the day was perused and seemed a good choice at 18 euros for two courses . The two courses could have been a starter and a main meal , a main meal and a dessert or a main meal and a coffee . We went in and booked in for 12. We could have sat outside but the heat of the day was getting a little too oppressive . Inside felt cool and inviting . So where did we start ? A non alcoholic lager for the driver as he had to drive on to Argeles later that day. I chose an aperatif - a Banyul sweet dessert wine. Thick and syrupy it lined my stomach well and sat well on the palate . Yes good choice for both of us . The next course was presented on flat rectangular plates laced with balsamic dressing . We had chosen pork of which there were four pieces neatly placed around a bed of pasta which in turn was covered in a mustard dressing . It all went down well and felt much better value than the meal at&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.travelblog.org/Photos/10365556\" onclick=\"return (&quot;10365556&quot;,&quot;&quot;);\"><img alt=\"Through the window \" src=\"https://photos.travelblog.net/206245/1066212/t/10365556-through-the-window-0.jpg\" /><img alt=\"Through the window \" src=\"https://www.travelblog.org/pix/shim.gif\" />Through the window</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>the Halle de la Machines . The dessert was a Tiramisu Corfee . It was Ok but the cream was very sickly and the sponge felt dry . Similar to a sponge that you put in the bottom of a trifle without soaking it in sherry. The meal was completed with an excellent espresso which set us up for the walk back down town and through the market . The plan to stock up on bread and chicken fell flat as by this time the market had packed up and all the stallholders gone home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe walked back to the sad looking aire and felt sorry that it had not worked out as planned . But that happens sometimes in life and camping is no different .</p>\r\n', 6, '2022-04-12 05:32:44.154132', '2022-04-12 05:32:44.154132', '2022-04-01 00:00:00.000000'),

Doing a load of laundry? Press play to an episode that&rsquo;ll change my life. Going for a walk? Might as well double up and engage in a little personal growth. While the inspirational podcasts we all know and love are definitely on my most-listened-to playlist&mdash;I&rsquo;m talking&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/oprahs-super-soul/id1264843400\" target=\"_blank\">Oprah&rsquo;s Super Soul</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/4P86ZzHf7EOlRG7do9LkKZ\" target=\"_blank\">Unlocking Us with Bren&eacute; Brown</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onbeing.org/series/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\">On Being with Krista Tippett</a>&mdash;the ones I have on repeat right now are&hellip; a little more obscure. Perhaps it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m expanding my horizons in terms of what it means to be a life-long learner, but I just find myself curious about everything. And the best thing about podcasts? There&rsquo;s always an episode for exactly the topic you want to dive into.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another thing I love about podcasts? The fact that they make an abundance of information easily accessible. From the moment I wake up to the time I go to bed, you can find me doing something productive. Between a morning workout, meditation, a full day of work, dinner, and the inevitable 1-2 hours I devote to personal projects in the evening, the idea of curling up with an inspiring book is almost laughable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what&rsquo;s my solution when time is limited but I still need a dose of motivation? A solid podcast. Despite a packed schedule, I never seem to run out of opportunities to multitask and tune in to some of my favorite shows. Whether I&rsquo;m at my desk, on a flight, in my car, working out, or cleaning around the house, I simply pop on my headphones and zone out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my podcast queue as of late? It&rsquo;s a healthy mix of pop culture deep-dives, real-talk reflections on wellness culture, and food podcasts whose narratives depend entirely upon the back-and-forth of a best friend pair. Okay, I&rsquo;ve teased them long enough&mdash;these are the podcasts you need to start listening to asap.

This Is Dating acknowledges all of that&mdash;and so much more. It isn&rsquo;t afraid to pursue and delve into the cringe-worthy elements of dating.

Through a series of recorded first dates, listeners get a privileged, adjacent-to-eavesdropping perspective into the world of dating as we know it.

(16, 'Searching for the Ultimate Dessert? These Salted Caramel Cheesecake Brownies Are It', '/static/posts-images/0d9a34c1-img_2057-scaled.jpg', '<p>When it comes to desserts (in my world, at least), more is more. Especially when it comes to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/galentines-day-gifts/\" target=\"_blank\">Galentine&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/collection/love-is-in-the-air/\" target=\"_blank\">Valentine&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;desserts&ndash;I want indulgence and richness in every bite. These brownies? All of that and more. I might have had three while watching all the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/feel-good-movies/\" target=\"_blank\">romantic comedies</a>&nbsp;for Galentine&rsquo;s Day with my gal pals. You might be thinking:&nbsp;<em>Aren&rsquo;t you tired of brownies after baking&nbsp;<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/best-brownie-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\">six different brownie recipes&nbsp;</a>for your last bake-off?&nbsp;</em>Nope. Now that I understand the science of brownies, I was excited to take my learnings and wrap them into my own recipe. Plus, there&rsquo;s no better time than the season of love to indulge in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/chocolate-hazelnut-cookies/\" target=\"_blank\">as much chocolate as possible</a>. With all that in mind, I set out to create the ultimate brownie recipe. Let me specify: Salted Caramel Cheesecake Brownies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I tested all those brownie recipes last week, I realized (in the middle of my thousandth bite) that adding a slightly tangy ingredient would balance out these brownies&rsquo; fudgy sweetness beautifully. A rich cheesecake with a salty bite was just the thing. (I know, tough decision.) So here&rsquo;s how this went down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1 OF 5</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Salted Caramel Cheesecake Brownies are the indulgent dessert to make tonight\" height=\"1161\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/a9749328-img_1979-820x1161.jpg\" width=\"820\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Brownie Layer:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After testing so many brownies, I discovered that my ideal chocolatey square is chewy with a little fudginess. I like the bite and chew from the edge pieces. The two recipes from my bake-off that had the brownies rest in the fridge after baking were also the ones with the most chew. And because these are more like brownie bars, I wanted them to hold up their shape when cut. So these brownies are chewy and dense, kind of like fudge. To really bring out the chocolatey flavor, I use both a little espresso powder and malted milk powder. While the malt powder is completely optional, after trying it in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/malted-forever-brownies\" target=\"_blank\">Claire Saffitz&rsquo;s recipe</a>, I don&rsquo;t know if I can make brownies without it again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A quick tip: Don&rsquo;t overbake your brownies! The longer you bake them the more you run the risk of getting dry and cakey brownies. I like to start testing my brownies at about the 25-minute mark. Then I pull them out of the oven just before they&rsquo;re completely done. They will continue to bake in the tray out of the oven, ensuring a nice fudgy consistency.</p>\r\n', 6, '2022-04-12 05:38:36.475368', '2022-04-12 05:38:36.475368', '2022-04-09 00:00:00.000000'),

With 27-year old Peltz in a custom Valentino couture gown designed by Zendaya&#39;s go-to designer Pierpaolo Piccioli, which took a year and multiple trips to Rome to create, it was down to Beckham to pull off something equally as spectacular.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that he did. While we&#39;re used to seeing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/gallery/david-and-victoria-beckham-couple-dressing\">David and Victoria Beckham</a>&#39;s eldest offspring in baggy skater jeans,&nbsp;<em>Peaky Blinders</em>-esque baker boy caps and Carhartt coach jackets (he &quot;wears the same thing everyday&quot;, he told&nbsp;<em>GQ</em>&nbsp;in 2021), for his nuptials Brooklyn Beckham went to French maison Dior, and family friend Kim Jones, for help.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Image may contain Brooklyn Beckham David Beckham Clothing Suit Overcoat Apparel Coat Human Person and Fashion\" src=\"https://media.gq-magazine.co.uk/photos/6253fc729e6b92a44dd39386/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Beckham%2520Family.jpeg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The British designer, who also heads up Fendi womenswear, has been the artistic director of Dior menswear since 2018 and has dressed the Beckham clan on countless occasions, so the partnership was an obvious and easy choice. David wore a bespoke morning suit to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/gallery/royal-wedding-guest-list-best-dressed\">Meghan Markle and Prince Harry&#39;s wedding</a>&nbsp;in 2018, while the entire Beckham brood have sat FROW at Jones&#39; catwalk shows in custom Dior looks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&#39;s more, Dior is newly-married Beckham&#39;s designer of choice for formalwear. &ldquo;For the red carpet it&#39;s always Dior,&rdquo; he told us last year. &ldquo;The suits the brand makes fit me well. I have these big, broad shoulders that I struggle to find a suitable jacket for. Dior&#39;s got it down. I have one that they&#39;ve given me and I wear when I need to.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Beckham&#39;s wedding, Jones and Dior created a super chic, custom black wool peak lapel tailcoat, which was cut to perfection and adorned with a silver chain at the front. It came with matching, straight-cut trousers and a white cotton wing-tip collar shirt with plastron piqu&eacute; and high-shine, jewellery buttons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By way of accessories Jones outfitted Beckham with a white bow tie and pocket square, while on his feet the 23-year old wore black polished leather derbies, which were stamped underfoot with Dior branding. A unique touch came by way of a bespoke label, designed by Peltz, which was sewn into Brooklyn&rsquo;s jacket. Rather nicely, Brooklyn wasn&#39;t alone in wearing Dior, either. David, Romeo and Cruz showed their support for Brooklyn by wearing matching black tuxedos, which were created in Paris by the French label.&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 7, '2022-04-12 05:43:59.185537', '2022-04-12 05:43:59.185537', '2022-04-02 00:00:00.000000'),
